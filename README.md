# capacitor-simulator
Interactive Capacitor Simulator built with Next.js and React — visualize electric field, charge, and energy with real-time physics calculations and neumorphic UI design.

# ⚡ Capacitor Simulator

An **interactive capacitor visualization tool** built with **Next.js** and **React**.  
This project demonstrates how capacitance, charge, and stored energy change dynamically based on voltage, plate area, separation distance, and dielectric material — all with a beautifully styled **neumorphic UI**.

## 🎮 Features

- 🧲 **Real-Time Simulation** – Adjust parameters like plate distance, area, voltage, and dielectric constant.  
- 🎨 **Dynamic Visualization** – Electric field, plates, and charge distribution are displayed interactively.  
- 🧪 **Physics-Based Calculations** – Uses real dielectric constants and ε₀ = 8.854×10⁻¹² F/m.  
- 📱 **Responsive UI** – Works seamlessly on mobile and desktop.  
- 🌈 **Neumorphic Design** – Smooth gradients, shadows, and elegant colors for a modern physics demo.
