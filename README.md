This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# capacitor-simulator
Interactive Capacitor Simulator built with Next.js and React — visualize electric field, charge, and energy with real-time physics calculations and neumorphic UI design.

# ⚡ Capacitor Simulator

An **interactive capacitor visualization tool** built with **Next.js** and **React**.  
This project demonstrates how capacitance, charge, and stored energy change dynamically based on voltage, plate area, separation distance, and dielectric material — all with a beautifully styled **neumorphic UI**.

---

## 🎮 Features

- 🧲 **Real-Time Simulation** – Adjust parameters like plate distance, area, voltage, and dielectric constant.  
- 🎨 **Dynamic Visualization** – Electric field, plates, and charge distribution are displayed interactively.  
- 🧪 **Physics-Based Calculations** – Uses real dielectric constants and ε₀ = 8.854×10⁻¹² F/m.  
- 📱 **Responsive UI** – Works seamlessly on mobile and desktop.  
- 🌈 **Neumorphic Design** – Smooth gradients, shadows, and elegant colors for a modern physics demo.

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **React Hooks**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **SVG for Visualization**
- **Custom Components** (Sliders, Selects, Result Cards)
